	"description": "A member of the decentralized criminal organization that has footprints all over the continent and even deep within unknown domains.\nCryo Potioneers are quite the welcome sight amongst the Treasure Hoarders due to their elixirs having the ability to rapidly cool things down. Even out in the wild where there are no Mist Flowers to be found, they can have some cold liquor to make merry with."
