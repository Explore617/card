	"description": "A wizened, mumbling hilichurl, one that awakens the might of Dendro.\nHilichurls especially gifted in commanding the elements who often reach the zenith of their skill in their twilight years. A grudge stirs beneath that mask, and poison ivy sprouts as hateful whispers issue forth from it."
