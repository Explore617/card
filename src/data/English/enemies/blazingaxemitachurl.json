	"description": "Muscular hilichurls who wield large two-handed axes.\nAttacks with large strikes, and will use Pyro Slimes to infuse their axes with Pyro. They are very lethal.\nUsually, repeatedly quenching a weapon the way a Blazing Axe Mitachurl does will decrease the hardness of the metal and cause the axe-head's edge to chip more easily. But such is the strength of the mitachurls that even should the edge disappear altogether, they can still use their axes as hammers."
