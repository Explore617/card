The egg has been beaten into the flour to form a dough and the shrimp and fish have been diced, minced, and packaged into the shape of a teacup, before being garnished with whole shrimp and steamed in a pot. The resulting design is like that of clouds embracing the moon, hence the name Fullmoon Egg.",

Take a bite while it's hot, and have your tastebuds savor the tender minced meat and delicious juice, an experience which is then topped off with a finishing touch of sweet prawn. Before your eyes, you can almost see a full moon over rippling waters, a fishing boat by the shore, and the fishermen's songs echoing down the years."
