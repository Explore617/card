		"description": "A dish with a tender mouthfeel. The tofu is so tender that it might break if you blew on a spoonful of it. Each granule of the crab roe is plump and filled with crab oil that oozes out onto your lips the moment you have a single bite. Chewing is not needed at all. The food travels down your gullet in a flash, leaving nothing but the memory of its fresh flavor."
