Every last droplet of moisture within the fish has been drained away, leaving behind naught but a texture that can only be compared to chewing on timber.

		"description": "Dried fish that has been grilled slowly over a charcoal flame. The rich fats ooze out as the fish meets the grill, and with those sizzling sounds, the fish is clothed in a burnished golden coat. The meat is firm but delicious, and the mouthfeel is quite delicate. Such is the unsurpassed gift of the seas."
