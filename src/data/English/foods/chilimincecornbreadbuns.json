The meat and vegetables are then washed, diced, before being fried quickly in an oiled wok. When eaten, the fried condiments must be placed into the empty space in the middle of the buns before they are eaten together. Between the crisp vegetables and the flavorful meat, this is solid, great flavor.",

		"description": "A traditional snack from Liyue. The intense charred aroma of the wok sits on the condiments, which are shoveled into the fluffy buns, filling the air with a fragrance that itself worth rave reviews. Just as the laboring hands of Liyue's people created this famous, prosperous harbor, these ordinary ingredients can be \"developed\" by one's labor into something surprising in its deliciousness.
