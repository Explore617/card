All the ingredients were sliced into ribbons in a single go, and after being washed, they were placed into the broth and cooked till they floated. The resulting flavor is light and fresh, and would not be out of place as a chef's recommendation in a Liyue restaurant.",

Only the rank taste of beans stands as proof that the main ingredient of this dish was tofu in the first place."

		"description": "A dish that is a test of one's knifework. The tofu, thread-thin as the autumn leaves, floats amidst the bowl, like mist in a forest, and the shredded bamboo shoots give the image a sweet, lustrous sheen, while the broth combines the essence of fowl and ham, giving off an unbelievable aroma. A single taste is enough to cause the customer to lose themselves in this fog of flavor."
